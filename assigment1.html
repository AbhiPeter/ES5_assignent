what is prototype and use of the prototype?

- All javascript object inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
- previously to add the property to a a constructor you must add it to the constructor function.
-with use of the prototype we can achieve this.
-prototype allow to inherit properties and methods.

prototype inheritance:-
-date object inherts from date.prototype.
-Array objects inherts from Array.prototype.

object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain.
date object array object inhertis from object object.prototype.


use of the prototype:-
-using prototype makes for faster object creation,since that function does not have to re-created each time a new object is created.

one example is also shown below how prototype works in console output.

    <script>
        function Person(firstName, lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }

        Person.prototype.fullName = function() {
            return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
        }

        let getData = new Person("suarubh", "shau");

        console.log(getData.fullName());
    </script>
